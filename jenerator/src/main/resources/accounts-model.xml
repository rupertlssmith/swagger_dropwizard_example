        Defines the possible types of tax table entries.
        'added' is for taxes that are added to invoices. When the business recieves an invoice with an added
        tax, it must pay that tax to the issuer of the invoice. When the business sends an invoice with an
        added tax, it expects the receiving party to pay that tax to the business and for the business to
        take responsibility for the tax. The tax will be posted to the primary account for the tax table entry.
        Sales tax is usually dealt with in this way.
        'deducted' is for taxes that are deducted at source, though the expense of the tax is carried by the
        receiver of the invoice. When the business receives an invoice with a deducted tax, it does not need
        to pay that tax to the issuer of the invoice, but does become liable for the paying the tax, so deducts
        it from the value of the invoice before paying it. The tax will be posted to the primary account for
        the tax table entry. Income tax, in a PAYE system, is usually dealt with in this way.
        'associated' is for taxes that are added to invoices, and arise as a consequence of making a payment
        to a party. The expense of the tax is carried by the issuer of the invoice, and the reciever of the
        invoice does not need to pay it. An associated tax entry will have an expense account associated with
        it. The tax is posted as a liability to the primary account for the tax table entry, and as an expense
        to the secondary account. Employers national insurance contributions are usually dealt with in this way.
        The associated tax category is split into 'liability' and 'expense', corresponding to the two different
        entries involved.

        Defines the possible types of tax accounting for tax entries. 'normal' is for taxes that become liable

        deffered until invoices are actually paid.
