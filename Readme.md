Accounts

Build Instructions
------------------

Prior to building all of the source needs to be obtained. The 'mygovscot_utils' directory exists in a separate Git repository, and this can either be cloned directly under Accounts, or symlinked to.

To clone mygovscot_utils under accounts do:

    ./clone_external_modules

To symlink mygovscot_utils do:

    cd .. (to parent directory to Accounts)
    git clone http://stash.digital.gov.uk/scm/mgv/mygovscot_utils.git
    cd accounts
    ./symlink_external_modules

Once you have all of the source code:
    
    mvn clean install


As described above the source code is split into a main Git repository and some utility code in the 'mygovscot_utils' Git repository. Some scripts are provided to simplify working with mutliple Git repositories.

    ./push_all
    ./pull_all
    ./stat_all

Which work as you might expect from the names.
    

    mvn idea:idea

OR

    mvn eclipse:eclipse

Open the resulting project files in your IDE.

Alternatively, the pom.xml file can be opened directly by IntelliJ or Eclipse.    


Note: For release versions only, not SNAPSHOTs.
        
When the database is to be migrated to a new release version, the DropWizard migration can be invoked like this:

    java -jar accounts_top-1.0.jar db migrate config.yml

Obviously, the database should be backed up prior to doing this. Note that there are commands to perform dry runs, and also to tag the schema, so that changes can be rolled back if required. See here for some more information:

http://dropwizard.readthedocs.org/en/latest/manual/migrations.html


Note: For development versions only, that is those ending with SNAPSHOT in the version name.

The migration scripts may be altered during development in order to prepare them for release. Only the migration scripts relating to the current version should ever be touched, previous version must be preserved. Due to the most recent version changing, it is better to completely wipe out and re-create the development database each time. This can be accomplished with these commands:

    java -jar accounts_top-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar db drop-all --confirm-delete-everything config.yml
    java -jar accounts_top-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar db migrate config.yml
                

Integration tests require a database to be set up in order to run, so they have been placed under separate source roots named 'src/integrationtests'. These can be run by making use of the 'it' build profile. For example:

    mvn clean install -Pit

The integration tests will perform a drop-create on the database, leaving the database with an up to date schema loaded.


Hibernate can generate the database schema automatically, and a build profile has been set up to do this. Run:

    mvn clean install -Pschemagen

The output schema will be in "top/target/schema-create.ddl".


Sonar can apply quality metrics to the code. Some additional configuration around sonar has been included in the Maven build, so that test coverage reports work correctly when a test in one module exercises code in another, and also for integration tests. The test coverage reports are aggregated accross the whole project. To run the full quality metrics through sonar use:

    mvn clean verify sonar:sonar -Pit,sonar


It can be useful to generate the coverage without running the full Sonar QA procedure.

To generate unit test coverage only:

    mvn clean install -Psonar

To generate unit and integration test coverage:

    mvn clean verify -Psonar,it

Once coverage is generated, it will be stored under 'code-coverage/jacoco.exec'. To create the report run:

    ./jacoco_report

This will invoke an Ant script to produce the report. Load the file at 'code-coverage/index.html' to view the report.
